The Git **feature that really** makes it stand apart _from nearly every_ other SCM out there is its branching model. 

Git allows *and encourages* you to have multiple **_local branches that_** can be ***entirely independent*** of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

This means that you can do things like:
* **Frictionless Context Switching.** Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.
* Role-Based Codelines. Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.[read more](www.iranitcollege.ir)

  pointed salt-eaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down
  the slope of the breakwater."
